        //SUMMARY OF THE RENDER FUNCTION: When the delegate function gets called, you're getting the current position of the camera. And in that position if the button is being pressed (the draw button), you're putting a sphere node in that position. So if you keep doing that, if you keep putting a sphere for every position in every scene that is being rendered, eventually you will form a line of spheres which makes it look like you're drawing something!
